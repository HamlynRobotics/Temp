WSRender: A Workspace Analysis and Visualization Toolbox for Robotic Manipulator Design and Verification

Abstract:
Workspace analysis is essential for robotic manipulators, which helps researchers to study, evaluate and optimize their designs based on specific criteria with due consideration of ergonomics and usability.  Although workspace analysis is a common research topic, current solutions provide design-specific evaluation and there is a lack of generic software tools for different hardware configurations. This paper presents WSRender, a versatile research-oriented framework for workspace analysis and visualization. It is based on the Orocos Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Matlab Robotic Toolbox. The software architecture is presented with four use cases for demonstrating its practical use in single robot, dual-arm manipulator performance evaluation, multi-robot interaction analysis and  master-slave mapping.

If you have questions for using the toolbox or is interested in collaboration, please contact Dandan Zhang or Francesco Cursi.
